# Think - Deep Reasoning & Solution Planning

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./general.instructions.md) to all solution planning and analysis.

**Command:** `/think`

## Purpose

Engage in comprehensive, deep reasoning and solution planning for complex technical challenges. This command initiates a thorough analysis process that takes 10+ minutes of structured thinking.

## Usage

```
/think [problem description]
```

**Examples:**

- `/think How should I architect a scalable user authentication system?`
- `/think Performance bottleneck in React component re-rendering`
- `/think Database schema design for multi-tenant application`
- `/think Implementing real-time features with minimal latency`

## Process Framework

### 1. Problem Decomposition

- Break down the challenge into core components
- Identify interconnected systems and dependencies
- Map out cause-and-effect relationships
- Determine scope boundaries and constraints

### 2. Multi-Perspective Analysis

- **Technical Perspective**: Architecture, performance, scalability implications
- **User Perspective**: UX/UI impact, accessibility considerations
- **Business Perspective**: Timeline, resource requirements, ROI
- **Security Perspective**: Vulnerabilities, compliance requirements
- **Maintenance Perspective**: Long-term sustainability, documentation needs

### 3. Solution Exploration

- Generate multiple solution approaches (minimum 3)
- Apply first principles thinking to each approach
- Consider both conventional and unconventional solutions
- Evaluate trade-offs for each option

### 4. Risk Assessment

- Identify potential failure points
- Assess implementation complexity (1-10 scale)
- Evaluate resource requirements
- Consider timeline implications
- Plan contingency strategies

### 5. Decision Matrix

- Define evaluation criteria with weights
- Score each solution against criteria
- Calculate weighted scores
- Identify the optimal solution with justification

```

## Best Practices

- Take time for genuine reflection (minimum 10 minutes)
- Question initial assumptions
- Consider edge cases and failure scenarios
- Document reasoning process for future reference
- Validate solution against all stakeholder needs
- Plan for iterative refinement and learning

## Integration

Use this command for:

- Complex architectural decisions
- Performance optimization planning
- Security implementation strategies
- Troubleshooting difficult bugs
- Technology selection and evaluation
- Refactoring large codebases
- Planning new feature implementations

## Success Criteria

- Clear problem definition and scope boundaries
- Multiple solution options with trade-off analysis
- Actionable implementation plan with concrete steps
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Measurable success metrics defined
- Stakeholder alignment on approach
