# Performance Analysis & Optimization

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./general.instructions.md) and [TypeScript React guidelines](./typescript-react.instructions.md) to all performance optimizations.

**Command:** `/perf`

## Purpose

Comprehensive performance analysis and optimization recommendations for the React TypeScript application, covering both runtime performance and development workflow optimization.

## Usage

```
/perf [scope] [options]
```

**Examples:**

- `/perf analyze --full-audit`
- `/perf bundle --size-analysis`
- `/perf runtime --check-components`
- `/perf build --optimize-pipeline`
- `/perf network --resource-optimization`

## When to Use

This command is ideal for:

- üìä **Performance audits** - Comprehensive application performance analysis
- üì¶ **Bundle optimization** - Reducing JavaScript bundle sizes and load times
- ‚ö° **Runtime optimization** - Component re-rendering and memory usage optimization
- üîÑ **Build performance** - Speeding up development and CI/CD build times
- üåê **Network optimization** - Resource loading and caching strategies
- üì± **Mobile performance** - Ensuring optimal performance on mobile devices

## Methodology

### 1. Performance Audit Framework

#### Bundle Analysis

- Analyze bundle size and identify heavy dependencies
- Check for code splitting opportunities
- Identify unused code and tree-shaking effectiveness
- Review dynamic imports and lazy loading implementation

#### Runtime Performance

- Measure Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Analyze React component re-render patterns
- Identify memory leaks and unnecessary computations
- Review network waterfall and resource loading

#### Build Performance

- Measure build times and identify bottlenecks
- Analyze TypeScript compilation performance
- Review Vite configuration optimization
- Check development server performance

### 2. Analysis Tools & Commands

```bash
# Bundle analysis
npm run build -- --analyze
npx vite-bundle-analyzer dist

# Performance profiling
npm run preview
# Use browser DevTools Performance tab

# Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse http://localhost:4173 --output=json --output-path=./perf-audit.json

# Bundle size tracking
npx bundlesize
```

### 3. Performance Checklist

#### React Optimization

- [ ] Implement React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Use useMemo/useCallback for expensive computations
- [ ] Optimize context providers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Implement proper key props for list items
- [ ] Check for unnecessary effect dependencies

#### Assets & Resources

- [ ] Optimize images (WebP, proper sizing, lazy loading)
- [ ] Implement font optimization strategies
- [ ] Review and optimize SVG assets
- [ ] Check for unused CSS and JavaScript

#### Network & Caching

- [ ] Implement proper HTTP caching headers
- [ ] Use service workers for caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize API requests (batching, deduplication)
- [ ] Review third-party script loading

#### Code Splitting

- [ ] Implement route-based code splitting
- [ ] Split vendor bundles appropriately
- [ ] Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- [ ] Optimize chunk splitting strategy

### 4. Metrics & Monitoring

#### Key Performance Indicators

- First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1
- Total bundle size < 250KB (gzipped)

#### Development Metrics

- TypeScript compilation time
