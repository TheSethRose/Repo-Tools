# Review - Comprehensive Code Review Process

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./general.instructions.md) to all code review assessments.

**Command:** `/review`

## Purpose

Perform thorough code reviews with focus on best practices, security, performance, maintainability, and adherence to project standards.

## Usage

```
/review [file/component/feature to review]
```

## Review Framework

### 1. Code Quality Assessment

- **Readability**: Clear naming, logical structure, appropriate comments
- **Maintainability**: Modular design, separation of concerns, documentation
- **Consistency**: Adherence to project coding standards and conventions
- **Complexity**: Cognitive load, cyclomatic complexity, potential simplifications
- **DRY Principle**: Identification of code duplication and refactoring opportunities

### 2. Architecture Review

- **Design Patterns**: Appropriate use of established patterns
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, dependency inversion
- **Component Structure**: Logical organization and clear interfaces
- **Data Flow**: Unidirectional data flow, state management patterns
- **API Design**: RESTful principles, consistent naming, proper HTTP methods

### 3. Security Analysis

- **Input Validation**: Sanitization and validation of user inputs
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Proper access controls and permissions
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, secure storage, privacy considerations
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Common security antipatterns and exploits
- **Dependencies**: Security audit of third-party packages

### 4. Performance Evaluation

- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Time and space complexity analysis
- **Resource Usage**: Memory leaks, unnecessary computations
- **Bundle Size**: Import optimization, tree shaking opportunities
- **Rendering Performance**: React optimization, memoization strategies
- **Network Optimization**: Caching, compression, lazy loading

### 5. Testing Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Component isolation, edge case coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction validation
- **End-to-End Tests**: User journey verification
- **Test Quality**: Meaningful assertions, test maintainability
- **Coverage Metrics**: Line, branch, and functional coverage

## Review Checklist
